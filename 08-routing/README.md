## Lesson Plan

- Choosing a router
- Router context
- Route
- Switch
- Link
- hooks

## EX

- Continue the previous login ex.
if you didn't do it you can take my solution
- You should have 3 routes:
  - /
  - /login
  - /todo
- You should create a header with navigation to the homepage and login page.
- The login page should contain the login component we created
- after success login you are redirected to the `/todo` page where you see the list of todos
